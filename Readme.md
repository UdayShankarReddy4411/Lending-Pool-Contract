# Lending Pool Contract

## Project Title
**Aptos Over-Collateralized Lending Pool Smart Contract**

## Project Description
The Lending Pool Contract is a decentralized finance (DeFi) smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain that enables users to participate in over-collateralized lending. Users can deposit collateral (AptosCoin) to borrow funds at competitive interest rates, ensuring the security and stability of the lending pool through mandatory over-collateralization.

The contract implements a simple yet robust lending mechanism where borrowers must deposit 150% collateral value relative to their borrowed amount, protecting lenders from default risk while providing borrowers with access to liquidity without selling their digital assets.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to create a secure, transparent, and efficient lending ecosystem on the Aptos blockchain that democratizes access to decentralized financial services. We aim to:

- **Empower Financial Inclusion**: Provide users worldwide with access to lending services without traditional banking barriers
- **Ensure Security**: Maintain protocol safety through over-collateralization and automated liquidation mechanisms
- **Promote Transparency**: Leverage blockchain technology to create fully auditable and transparent financial operations
- **Drive Innovation**: Establish a foundation for more complex DeFi products and services on Aptos
